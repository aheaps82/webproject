<h1>Suicide Prevention</h1>



<p>Suicide has become one of the leading causes of death in the United 
	States. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 
	that suicide was responsible for 48,000 deaths in 
	2021. In 2021, an estimated 12.3 million adults seriously 
	thought about suicide, 3.5 million made a plan, and 1.7 
	million attempted suicide.</p>

<h2>Prevention is possible</h2>

<p>In a lot of cases, suicide can be prevented. It is important to 
	learn the warning signs and risk factors, which can include change 
	in personality, depression, recent life crisis, self-harm behavior, 
	and making comments about wanting to die. If a loved one talks 
	about suicide, take their words seriously. Encourage them to 
	seek professional help and listen without judgement.</p>
